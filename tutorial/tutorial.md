# Tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to familiarize an individual with the basics of the Android Studio SDK
and develop a simple application with enabling multiple pages, buttons, notifications, and text.

# Setup

The first step is to download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio|) for your
machine. Note that it is recommended that your system is equipped with 16GB of RAM and 16GB of
storage to run the android emulators and develop an application. However, the emulator can be
skipped and a physical device may be used [(read more)](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device).

Once Android Studio is installed, open it and:
1. Create a new project by clicking the **New Project**
button and select the **Basic Views Activity** or **Empty Views Activity**. 
2. After doing this, give your project a name, such as 'MyFirstApp' or 'TestApp' and select the 
language to be Java instead of Kotlin. 
3. Select the **Minimum SDK** to be 'API 32 ("SV2"; Android 12L)'
or similar or higher to mitigate compatibility issues. 
4. Select the **Build Configuration
Language** to be 'Kotlin DSL (build.gradle.kts)'.
5. Hit **Finish**.

Congratulations! You've just completed the setup for your first Android application!
