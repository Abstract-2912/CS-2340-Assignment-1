# Tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to familiarize an individual with the basics of the Android Studio SDK
and develop a simple application with multiple pages, buttons, and text.

# Setup
---
The first step is to download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio|) for your 
machine. Note that it is recommended that your system is equipped with 16GB of RAM and 16GB of 
storage to run the android emulators and develop an application. However, the emulator can be 
skipped and a physical device may be used [(read more)](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device).

Once Android Studio is installed, open it and create a new project by clicking the **New Project**
button and select the **Basic Views Activity** or **Empty Views Activity**. After doing this,
give your project a name, such as 'MyFirstApp' or 'TestApp' and select the language to be Java
instead of Kotlin. Additionally select the **Minimum SDK** to be 'API 32 ("SV2"; Android 12L)' 
or similar or higher to mitigate compatibility issues. Additionally, select the **Build Configuration 
Language** to be 'Kotlin DSL (build.gradle.kts)', and hit **Finish**.

Congratulations! You've just completed the setup for your first Android application!
